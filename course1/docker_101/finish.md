### WELL DONE !

* Kubernetes documentation for container runtimes [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/).

* CNCF container runtime definition [here](https://landscape.cncf.io/guide#runtime--container-runtime).

* [Runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc) is an implementation of the standard. At the time of writing, it is a repackaging of [libcontainer](https://github.com/docker/libcontainer).

ðŸ’¡ Interesting fact, Kubernetes "doesnâ€™t know" how to run containers it relies on the container runtime for running and managing containers on a host.
