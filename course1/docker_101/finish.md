### WELL DONE !

* Kubernetes documentation for container runtimes [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/)

* CNCF container runtime definition [here](https://landscape.cncf.io/guide#runtime--container-runtime)

ðŸ’¡ Interesting fact, Kubernetes "doesnâ€™t know" how to run containers it relies on the container runtime for running and managing containers on a host.
