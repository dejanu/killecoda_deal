## Setup

For configuration, `kubectl` looks for a file named config in the `$HOME/.kube` directory. You can specify other kubeconfig files by setting the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable or by using the `--kubeconfig` flag.

Explore the cluster configuration `kubect get no`, what happens:
```bash
couldn't get current server API group list
```
