* kubectl reference [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/)

* The file that is used to configure access to a cluster is usually, called kubeconfig ( `~/.kube/config`), but you can easily override the location by using `--kubeconfig=<path_to_config>` flag.

* A Kubernetes config file describes clusters, users, and contexts. You can have **multiple** contexts in order to target different Kubernetes **clusters**.
